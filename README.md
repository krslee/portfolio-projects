# Data Analyst Portfolio
### Hi, my name is Kristine.
Growing up, I've always been curious about the way in which people perceive and interact with the world, others, and even themselves. As such, I very much enjoyed my time in college studying cognitive science, especially with it being such an interdisciplinary field. However, as time went on, I knew I wanted to find a domain beyond academic research where I could utilize my technical and research background. 

In figuring out how I wanted to establish my career path, I began to look into data analysis through the recommendation of a family member. Beginning by rediscovering SQL, I eventually found myself more and more interested in the process and work involved in data analysis. As a logical but creative thinker, I like asking questions and solving problems, finding satisfaction in figuring out the missing pieces of a puzzle. 

I've created this repository to share some of my projects and showcase my skills.
